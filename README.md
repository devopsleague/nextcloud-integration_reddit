### User settings

The account configuration happens in the "Connected accounts" user settings section.

A link to the "Connected accounts" user settings section will be displayed in the widget for users who didn't configure a Reddit account.

### Admin settings

There also is a "Connected accounts" **admin** settings section if you want your Nextcloud users to use another OAuth application to authenticate to Reddit. The Nextcloud Reddit OAuth app is used by default.
